- **Libraries:** 
    - Install `pygame` for sound effects: `pip install pygame`
    - `turtle` is usually included with Python.

**2. Running the Game:**

1. **Clone or download the repository:** Get the code from GitHub or download the files directly.
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** Open a terminal or command prompt and use the `cd` command to go to the folder containing the game files.

## How It Works

- **Screen Setup:** The game uses the `turtle` library to create a visual interface, setting the screen dimensions and background.
- **Object Creation:** It creates a player turtle, a car manager to handle car generation and movement, and a scoreboard to track progress.
- **Game Loop:** The core of the game runs in a continuous loop, performing the following actions:
    - Updates the turtle's position based on player input.
    - Creates and moves cars at increasing speeds.
    - Detects collisions between the turtle and cars.
    - Updates the scoreboard and handles level progression.
    - Plays sound effects to enhance the gameplay experience.
